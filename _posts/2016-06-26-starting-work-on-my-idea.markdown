I have been thinking about an idea since the last few month, it is a search engine for source code. There are lots of web application out there which are provide search over code base such as sourcegraph.com and Opengrok These application return results which match the user search keywords, they don't use the meta information that can be used to explain the source code in more detail. 

For example, if a open source project uses Apache lucence heavily it could be a search/information retrieval project. Such contextual information is completely unused, due to this large chunk of projects on github are not discoverable. If we are able to create contextual metadata about a project it would greatly improve its chance of begin discovered during a search. 

Building such a search is a complex task, but completely possible. I will start small and start thinking about the pieces which will be required to build this search. As the first step I want to do a better job at explaining the idea to some people, it will help me gain clarity of my own ideas. Thanks for reading.
